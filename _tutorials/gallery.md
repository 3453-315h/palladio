Palladio allows you to create a gallery view of your data, including image, title, subtitle, additional text, and a link.  You can also sort the visualization.

When you initially move to the Gallery view, the first column in your dataset is chosen as the Title.

![Gallery Initial Settings]({{ site.urlimg }}resources/GalleryInitialSettings.png)

For each gallery element, you can select a subtitle, longer text, a link to visit when a card is clicked (only accepts data elements types as URL), an image (again, accepts a URL to the image), and the option to sort the gallery.
![Gallery After Selection]({{ site.urlimg }}resources/GalleryAfterSelection.png)

Note that if the Title, Subtitle or Additional Text are not selected, they will display "select a text dimension"
