title: Impact of Overlapping Filters
category: tutorial
---


The Facet, Timeline, and Timespan filters each allow filtering by multiple parameters, and the various criteria overlap in different ways.

When applying multiple criteria within a facet filter, only rows that meet _all_ criteria will be included in the display.  When selecting multiple timelines, rows that meet _any_ criteria will be included in the display.

If you create two or more filters, only rows that meet _all_ criteria in all filters will be included in the display.
